=========

C codes which support a book on using PETSc for PDEs.

  * I will maintain and support these example codes in the long term.

### install PETSc

Follow instructions at [www.mcs.anl.gov/petsc/documentation/installation.html](http://www.mcs.anl.gov/petsc/documentation/installation.html).

  * My book does not contain PETSc installation instructions, though it has minimal advice.  Maintaining installation information is the job of PETSc developers, not me.  Thank goodness.
  * Also, my book does not help the reader with debugging C programs.

### compile and run one code

Do this to build the first code:

    $ cd ch1
    $ make e
    $ ./e
    $ mpiexec -n 20 ./e

### regression test the codes

    $ make test

Tested with PETSc master branch.

### clean up

    $ make distclean
